* the oo is not good

  - the oo is slow,
    and the syntax is not good.

  - but we must maintain the ability
    to use low level untype code to implement objects.

  - maybe we can use message like syntax of function call without oo

* maybe gc and oo

  - no gc
    - how should we manage memory

  - no oo
    - what is the use of tag ?
    - we can not simply implement oo by message sending
      because we can not use (loop) and (recur) in them.
      - add thoes keywords for message ?

* low-level and high-level syntax macro

  - currently syntax macro is not good enough
    to let us change the syntax as in lisp.x

  - maybe it is not good to use low-level at reader level.

* maybe fall back

  - maybe we should fall back to c like struct,
    and go without gc and oo.

    this is hardly a good choice.

  - maybe we should try to improve the syntax macro system.
    if macro become easier to define,
    the language will be worth using again.
