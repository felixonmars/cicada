jojo is a dependently typed language,

  - the syntax of which is optimized for function composition,
    instead of function application.

  - >< trait [or type-class]

  - >< quotient type

  - >< forgetful functor

  - >< which uses a actor model to write distributed applications.

  - >< the type-checker of jojo can be used as a prover,
    to prove theorems in the realm of constructive mathematics,
    and to verify invariants of programs.
