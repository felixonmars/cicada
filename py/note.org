#+title: jojo note

- [py] give up the use of 'recur', and use 'ifte' for basic branching

- fix arguments of function call

* [todo-stack]

*** @jojo

*** new version

    - separate VM and compiler
      - VM in python
      - compiler in jojo

    - compiler handles proper tail call

    - typed version of the language still compile to the VM

*** fix debug_repl

*** better p_debug

    - some call to p_debug can not return
      this should be reported to user

*** better p_step

*** trace and untrace a jojo

*** delimited continuation

    - to control rs [and ds]

*** concurrent

    - use list to implement rs and ds in jojo
      thus each group of stacks is a light weight process
