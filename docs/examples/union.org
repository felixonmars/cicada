    1. subtype relation

    2. a case-clause refines a union-type

       of constructing data of subtype of this union-type

  - union can must be able to handle

    - string-t < sexp-u
      sexp-u list-u < sexp-u

    - node-t : name-t -> type-tt
      edge-t : name-t, name-t -> type-tt
      edge-t < path-u
      node-t < [dup path-u]
