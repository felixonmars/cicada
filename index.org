---------

- a low-level untyped language
  it is an interpreter
  but I view it as an extensible virtual machine

- when you design a language
  often you have a low-level computation model in mind
  and implement this computation model by a virtual machine
  the intend usage of jojo is
  to implement such low-level computation model
